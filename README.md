H3 Control Flow Keywords (Decide what happens next)
if, elif, else = Check conditions and decide what to do next.

for, while = Repeat a task multiple times using loops.

break = Stops the loop immediately.

continue = Skips the current loop iteration and moves to the next.

pass = A placeholder that does nothing but prevents errors.

H3 Function and Class Keywords (Define reusable code)
def = Defines a function to reuse code.

return = Sends a value from a function to where it was called.

lambda = Creates a short, one-line function without a name.

class = Creates a blueprint for objects in Object-Oriented Programming.

H3 Exception Handling Keywords (Handle errors)
try = Starts a block of code to check for errors.

except = Handles the error if one occurs in the try block.

finally = Runs code no matter what, even if an error happens.

raise = Creates a custom error message.

assert = Stops the program if a condition is false.

H3 Import Keywords (Use external code)
import = Brings in a module (extra code) from Python’s library.

from = Imports only specific parts of a module.

as = This keyword allows you to give a new, shorter name to a module or function, making it easier to use in your code.

H3 Variable and Data Handling Keywords
True, False = Boolean values representing Yes (True) or No (False).

None = Represents an empty or unknown value.

del = Deletes a variable or an item from a list.

global = Lets you change a variable that was made outside a function.

nonlocal = Lets you change a variable from an outer function when inside an inner function.

H3 Logical and Comparison Keywords
and = Returns True if both conditions are true.

or = Returns True if at least one condition is true.

not = Reverses the truth value of a condition.

in = Checks if a value exists in a list, string, or dictionary.

not in = Checks if a value does not exist in a list, string, or dictionary.

is = Checks if two variables refer to the same object.

is not = Checks if two variables refer to different objects.

H3 Asynchronous Programming Keywords
async = Defines a function that runs asynchronously (in the background).

await = Waits for an async function to finish before continuing.

H3 Google Collab
What is Google Colab?

Google Colab (Colaboratory) is a free online tool by Google that allows you to write and run Python code in your web browser without installing anything. It is mainly used for machine learning, data science, and Python coding.

Why Use Google Colab?

-No Installation Needed = Works in a browser, so you don’t need to install Python.

-Free Access to GPUs & TPUs = Helps run programs faster, especially for AI and deep learning.

-Google Drive Integration = You can save and open files from Google Drive easily.

-Share and Collaborate = Just like Google Docs, you can share your Colab notebook with others.

-Pre-installed Libraries = Many Python libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow) are already installed.

How to Use Google Colab?

-Go to Google Colab.

-Click on "New Notebook" to start writing Python code.

-Write Python code in the cells and click the Run button (or press Shift + Enter) to execute.

-Save your work in Google Drive or download it as a .ipynb or .py file.
